Write a program that takes three space separated numbers as input.Prints "Increasing" if the numbers are in strictly increasing order,Decreasing" if they are in strictly decreasing order,and "Neither" otherwise.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    if(a < b && b < c)
        cout << "Increasing";
    else if(a > b && b > c)
        cout << "Decreasing";
    else
        cout << "Neither";

    return 0;
}
