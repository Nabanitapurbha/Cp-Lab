//Lets start with a simple problem - you need to write a program which does the following
//Accepts the number of inputs / test cases as 't'.
//The only line of each test case contains 2 integers - declare them as variables 
A and B.
//For each test case, you need to perform the following operations.
//Create a variable S - the sum of the 2 input integers.Create a variable -P - the product of the 2 input integers.Output 2 space separated integers S and P in a single line



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    for(int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int A, B;
        cin >> A >> B;

        int S = A + B;
        int P = A * B;

        cout << S << " " << P << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
